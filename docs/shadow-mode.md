# Shadow mode

Shadow mode runs the detector beside the farm loop while a match plays and logs what it sees. It sends no input: farm mode drives exactly as it does today.

## Turning it on

Set `shadow = true` under `[behavior]` in `config.toml` under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\brawlfarm`, then restart the instance. There is no switch in the panel yet.

It needs a model: `models\play.onnx` and `models\play.json` under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\brawlfarm`. Nothing else: `onnxruntime` is already a core dependency, so a plain install can run shadow mode. No model ships yet; without one, shadow mode says `model_missing` once in the feed and does nothing. With the `play-gpu` extra installed the detector runs on CUDA; see [install.md](install.md).

## What it writes

Shadow files land under `instances\<name>\shadow\`, one JSON lines file per match, with boxes and timings only. The newest 50 files are kept.

Three feed rows carry shadow mode: `play_on` when a session starts, `play_summary` once the match ends, and `play_fallback` when a session gives up, with a reason such as `model_missing`, `model_invalid`, `source_start`, `source_error`, `stale`, `detector_error` or `session_error`.

## Cost

Shadow mode captures the instance screen about 5 times a second. Measured against a run with it off on the same night, it costs the in-match farm loop about 8 percent at the median tick and about 13 percent at the ninety-fifth.
