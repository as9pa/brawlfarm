# brawlfarm

![The Fleet page: one card per instance with today's games and trophies](docs/img/fleet.png)

An open-source Brawl Stars trophy farmer for BlueStacks on Windows, with a local control panel in your browser.

**Install:** `uv tool install brawlfarm` (Windows 11, BlueStacks 5 with adb on, Python 3.13 and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/))

## What it does

- **Farms Trio Showdown:** queue, play, results, back to the menu, repeat.
- **Survives interruptions:** rewards, popups, rank-ups, disconnects, crashes, freezes, team invites.
- **Two farm modes:** ladder (the whole roster in 100-trophy tiers) or prestige (one brawler to 1000 at a time), plus an optional maxed fallback.
- **Anti-ban scheduler:** human-shaped sessions with breaks, on by default.
- **Many instances:** several BlueStacks instances at once, one worker per instance.
- **Local panel:** live screens, activity feed, farm plan, schedule, stats, settings and calibration.
- **Alerts:** webhook, ntfy and a healthchecks.io ping on every supervisor tick.
- **Never spends:** never taps ACCEPT on a team invite, GET or Upgrade, EQUIP NOW, any shop buy button, the pass VAULT, or anything priced in gems; never blind-taps in the shop.
- **Checks before it taps:** every navigation verifies the screen and bails to the menu on a failed check, so stale coordinates become logged no-ops.
- **Stops by PID:** a worker is stopped by the PID in its instance's status file, never by name.
- **No AI in the loop:** deterministic OpenCV template matching and OCR.

The last four are safety rails: absolute, and enforced in code and in review.

## Requirements

- Windows 11.
- BlueStacks 5 (the nxt line) with Android Debug Bridge enabled.
- Each instance's display at 1600 x 900 and pixel density 240.
- Python 3.13 and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

Hardware sizing and the play extras: [docs/install.md](docs/install.md#requirements).

## Install

```
uv tool install brawlfarm
```

Or clone the repository and `uv sync`. The desktop window, play stream and GPU extras are in [docs/install.md](docs/install.md#install).

## Running

```
brawlfarm
```

Supervises every instance and opens the panel at `http://127.0.0.1:8765/`; the wizard at `/setup` finds adb, lists your instances and checks their display. From a checkout: `uv run brawlfarm`. Flags: [docs/install.md](docs/install.md#running).

## Status

v1.1.0, the panel pass over copy, the component kit, fleet, instance, stats, settings, calibration and narrow screens; every phase in the plan has shipped. Main has since added the Stats placement pass and the play-mode kits: dataset, HUD reader, detector shadow mode and showdown maps.

## Screenshots

The panel, running against a scratch data directory with three example instances on a scheduled break, with nothing listening on their adb ports.

Settings: instances, connection, behavior switches, notifications, data and about.

Calibration: what the panel looks for on the screen, the recorder and observe switches, and the thresholds in force.
