"""Regression tests for the mid-session brawler reselect (the "CROW 336/100" bug).

Owner's law (discord-v3-refinements.md A1): in ladder mode, if the farmed brawler
is above — or climbs above — the CURRENT ladder step goal, the worker must switch.
The bug: the controller compared against a goal FROZEN at selection time (or the
1000 default after a farmplan hiccup), so when the roster minimum moved (e.g. a
drop unlocked a new brawler at 0, pulling the step down to 0-100) the worker kept
grinding a 336-trophy brawler against a stale goal. The fix re-evaluates the plan
goal against the live roster on every trophy snapshot.

These tests drive Controller._check_farm_brawler_trophies directly (no adb, no
API): the controller object is built without __init__ and farmplan.load_plan is
patched, so the check's inputs are exactly the live player payload + the plan.
