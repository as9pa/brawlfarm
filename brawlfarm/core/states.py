"""
Per-frame screen classification.

We detect reliable ANCHOR screens via template matching. The controller's state
machine (core/controller.py) uses these; UNKNOWN is resolved by phase context.

Validated separations (own screen vs others) at the thresholds below:
  play / playagain / proceed / exit / trophy_screen -> crisp (~1.0 vs <=0.5)
  matchmaking -> clean;  teams_left (in-match) -> 0.98-1.0 vs <=0.47 off-match
  reload (disconnect) -> 1.0 on both disconnect modals; other_device distinguishes them

#     guidance — so we only move/attack when actually in a match, never blind-swiping
#     a loading screen.
#   * trophy_screen (black "TROPHIES" — Trophy Road) and trophy_brawler (white
#     "TROPHIES" header — the brawler rank/trophy detail auto-shown at rank-up
#     milestones) are two variants of the same never-linger screen; the returning

# Phase-aware check order (config.PHASE_CLASSIFY): the controller passes its phase so
# classify can test the EXPECTED anchor first (find returns on first hit, so order =
# expected-case latency). Two hard rules, both corpus-validated (562 real frames,
# tools/validate_gray_thresholds.py — zero decision changes vs _BASE_ORDER):
#
#   1. REORDER ONLY, never a subset. An earlier draft skipped `matchmaking` in
#      `playing`; wrong — phase_queuing hands off to `playing` on an UNKNOWN flicker
#      once matchmaking has been seen, so a MATCHMAKING frame can still arrive under
#      the `playing` hint, and the run loop treats UNKNOWN specially (daily-streak/
#      team-invite OCR + the unknown-streak foreground probe).
#   2. `matchmaking` must stay BEHIND play + the results anchors. Its template
#      co-matches at 0.90–0.97 on many MENU and RESULTS frames (164/562 in the
#      corpus, both color and gray) — only the play/results-first priority masks
#      that. A `queuing` order with matchmaking first misclassified 40+ menu frames
#      as MATCHMAKING, so queuing keeps _BASE_ORDER (the matchmaking hit then costs
#      4 cheap gray misses first — fine).
#
#   * playing: teams_left first (the common case — every in-match frame otherwise
#     pays for 5 misses before it). Safe to move ahead of everything: teams_left
#     co-matches nothing in the anchor set (its high off-state scores occur only
#     under reload/close_x overlays, which are checked before any anchor).
#   * queuing / returning / at_menu: base order (menu/results anchors already lead).
