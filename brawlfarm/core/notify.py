"""
Push notifications for unattended runs.

Ping your phone the moment the farm bot stops, recovers, or crashes — so a 10-hour
overnight session doesn't need babysitting. Two backends; configure whichever you
use via .env (loaded by config):

  Webhook:  BRAWL_WEBHOOK_URL=https://...    (legacy DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL still honoured)
  ntfy.sh:  NTFY_TOPIC=some-unique-topic     (optional NTFY_SERVER, default https://ntfy.sh)

If neither is set, every call here is a no-op, so the bot runs fine without it.
All network errors are swallowed — a failed alert must never crash or stall the
farm loop.

Entry points:
  notify(title, message, screenshot=None) -> bool
      Low-level send. `screenshot` may be a BGR numpy frame (from adb.screencap())
      or a path; it's attached as a PNG. Returns True if a backend accepted it.
  maybe_alert(kind, fields) -> None
      Convenience used by the data logger: turns a session event (kind + fields)
      into a text alert. Safe to call very often; only ALERT_KINDS actually fire.
  alert_title(kind) -> str
      The human title for an alert kind, shared with the control panel's alert list
      so a phone notification and the panel name the same event the same way.
  ping_healthchecks() -> bool
      GET the configured healthchecks.io (or compatible) ping URL. The supervisor
      calls it at the end of every tick, so a supervisor that stops ticking raises
      an alarm. Never raises.
