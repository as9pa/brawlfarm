"""
Thin wrapper around BlueStacks' bundled adb (HD-Adb.exe).

This is the bot's hands and eyes:
  - connect()      -> make sure adb is talking to the BlueStacks instance
  - screencap()    -> grab the current screen as an OpenCV image (numpy array)
  - tap()          -> tap a single point
  - swipe()        -> swipe / drag between two points (also used for the joystick)

We shell out to adb with subprocess. Everything is addressed to one specific
device via the serial (e.g. "127.0.0.1:5555") so it keeps working even if you
have multiple BlueStacks instances open.
