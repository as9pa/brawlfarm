Central configuration for the Brawl Stars automation bot.

Everything that might change between machines, BlueStacks setups, or game updates
lives here so the rest of the code never hard-codes a path, port, or coordinate.

Coordinates assume the LOCKED display: 1600x900, DPI 240. The bot asserts this at
startup (see core/controller.py's run()) so a changed resolution can't silently
misfire taps.

# "Virtual Touch" — a type-A multitouch, position-only node (ABS_MT_POSITION_X/Y only),

# faster per capture (569 -> 370 ms median, measured on this machine; see the legacy
# research note "performance optimization", item 4, not ported). core/adb.py uses this

# rate is subnormal AND it is not on a winstreak ("if it's been running a while
# with little improvement it should switch — but never mid-winstreak", r6 owner
# rule; the winstreak guard lives in farmplan.recent_winstreak). Calibrated
# 2026-06-10 against three live farms' games.csv (~1,800 showdown games; the three
# accounts are labelled A, B and C in the notes below — A and B sit in the low
# ladder bands, C is near-maxed):
#   * mean trophyChange/game: A +6.6, B +6.2 (ladder bands), C +2.3 (high bands)
#   * a 10-game trailing mean < 0 occurred in 0% (B) / 1.3% (A) of windows —
#     normal variance essentially never sustains a NET LOSS over 10 games
#   * C's genuinely stagnant high-band brawlers (GIGI/OTIS/FINX) sat below 0 for
#     5-8 consecutive windows — exactly the stagnation the rotation must catch
# So: rotate when the last OPTIMAL_RATE_WINDOW games on the farmed brawler average
# below OPTIMAL_RATE_MIN trophies/game ("the brawler is net-losing"). Fewer logged
# games than the window = not enough evidence, never rotate. Rotation state lives
# in controller memory (session-scoped, reset on worker restart) — a transient
# cold streak never sticks to the plan file across sessions.

# "opportunity_cost" (a marginally-hotter in-band alternative exists). On the
# near-maxed account C the latter fired on EVERY freshly-selected brawler —
# often within the same second, before it played a single game — because the
# lowest brawlers (all ~800-1000) have near-identical rates, so something always
# scores marginally higher. Result: the worker thrashed in the brawler menu
# (32 reselects / 10 h, 30 of them opportunity_cost) and made no progress. The

# --- Win-rate-aware selection (Q2, legacy planning note "winrate-aware farming", not ported) ---
# PROACTIVE companion to the reactive rotation above: at ladder selection
# points, farmplan re-orders the LEGAL candidates (owned brawlers below the current
# step goal — so the ladder floor invariant is untouched by construction) by their
# trailing net trophy rate, and promotes the top one only when it beats the
# roster-minimum brawler's score by >= WINRATE_MARGIN trophies/game. Margin +
# min-sample + neutral-prior are the anti-churn rails: a brawler with fewer than
# WINRATE_MIN_GAMES logged showdown games scores the account-wide trailing mean
# (neither favored nor punished), so a fresh/missing/garbled games.csv degrades
# bit-identically to today's lowest-trophy flow. Prestige mode never consults any
# of this (its pick is a goal statement, never overridden).
# Offline replay vs the live farms' games.csv + live API rosters (2026-06-10,
# table in PR evidence): account C (ladder, step 700, 9 in-band candidates) promotes
# OTIS (+3.25/game over 20 logged games) over roster-min DOUG (8 games -> the
# +1.90 prior), margin +1.35; accounts A and B change NOTHING — every in-band
# candidate there is under the 10-game min-sample (fresh 0-100 bands), all
# score the prior, and the default lowest-trophy flow holds. Exactly the
# designed split: promote on real evidence, fall through on cold start.
# Kill-switch: BRAWL_WINRATE_AWARE=0 pins today's selection without a deploy
# (FAST_INPUT-style convention). Ships ON: the margin gate keeps "on"
# conservative until the data clearly favors a candidate.

# --- Win-rate model v2 (r8, legacy research note "winrate model", not ported) --
# v2 keeps the surface (WINRATE_AWARE kill-switch, WINRATE_MARGIN gate, the
# ladder-only by-name promotion) but upgrades the STATISTICS the score is built on:
#
#   (a) Empirical-Bayes SHRINKAGE — a brawler's score is pulled toward the
#       account's own overall mean trophyChange/game (mu0, computed from games.csv)
#       with prior strength WINRATE_PRIOR_K games:  (n*ewma + k*mu0)/(n+k). This
#       replaces v1's hard min-sample/neutral-prior CLIFF (9 games -> the prior,
#       10 games -> the raw mean) with a smooth pull, killing small-sample
#       overreaction in BOTH the pick bias and the rotation trigger. k=10 means a
#       brawler needs ~10 effective games before its own rate outweighs the prior.
#   (b) Recency-weighted EWMA — an exponentially-weighted mean (half-life
#       WINRATE_HALFLIFE games) over the brawler's history instead of a hard
#       window, so form changes register without a cliff at the window edge. The
#       effective sample size (sum of EWMA weights) saturates near
#       HALFLIFE/ln2 (~36 games at hl=25), so a long cold tail can't dominate.
#
# Constants are unitless trophies/game (same scale as OPTIMAL_RATE_*). Calibrated
# by reasoning + an offline replay against the live farms' games.csv (table in the
# PR / the model doc): k=10 and hl=25 keep "on" conservative — A/B (fresh low
# bands) still fall through to the lowest-trophy default; C's well-sampled
# high-band gaps (OTIS/GIGI/FINX) are the cases the shrinkage lets through on real

# independent, coarser check says "something IS there" while the calibrated detector
# says 0); core/controller.py streaks it in data/<acct>/recalib.json and emits a
# "recalibrate" event at the threshold (one alert per surface per account per day;
# the streak keeps counting while cooled down). ADVISORY ONLY: it never pauses
# farming or skips a sweep, and an exception in any tripwire codepath can never
# affect the sweep result. BRAWL_RECALIB_TRIPWIRE=0 turns it all off (no extra
# computation, no events). (r8: the shop-freebie surface was dropped with the shop.)
