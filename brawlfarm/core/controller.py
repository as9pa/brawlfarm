"""
The bot's brain: a contextual state machine that farms Trio Showdown matches.

Phases (distinct from the per-frame State in states.py):
  returning  -> get back to a known MAIN MENU, clearing any reward/Star-Drop popups
  at_menu    -> log trophies + battlelog, verify Trio Showdown, press PLAY
  queuing    -> wait through matchmaking (no taps near the Exit button)
  playing    -> tap the attack point (and Super, harmless) on cadence until results
(There is no "results" phase — RESULTS frames are a per-frame State handled inside
the returning/queuing/playing phases via advance_results.)

Why contextual instead of pure per-frame detection: in-match scenes can't be
template-matched reliably, but the EXIT conditions (menu, results, matchmaking)
can. So we anchor on those and treat UNKNOWN according to the phase we're in.

Safety rails (for unattended overnight running):
  - assert 1600x900 at startup
  - freeze detection -> relaunch the game
  - bounded recoveries -> hard stop with a clear log if we can't reach a known state
  - --max-games / --max-minutes caps; Ctrl-C exits cleanly
  - never taps the matchmaking Exit; never blindly mass-taps an unknown dialog forever
