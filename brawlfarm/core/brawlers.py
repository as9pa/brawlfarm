"""
Select the lowest-trophy brawler — a once-per-session startup action (not part of the
per-frame farm loop). The farm plays whatever brawler is selected, so to grind
efficiently we keep the lowest-trophy one active (most headroom before the 1000 cap).

Flow (open from menu -> act -> exit to menu via taps):
  menu -> BRAWLERS button (left side) -> sort by "Least Trophies" -> make sure the Quest
  and Heart/Favorites filter toggles are OFF -> tap the TOP-LEFT card (now the lowest-
  trophy brawler) -> tap SELECT on the detail screen -> back to the menu.

Why the toggles must be OFF: when the Quest or Heart filter is ON the grid is reduced to
a subset, so the top-left card is no longer the global lowest. An ON toggle shows an
ORANGE check badge; the Quest clipboard icon's own check is BLUE (always there), so we
gate on ORANGE specifically.

Safety: TAPS only, never the Android BACK key (project rule); exit via the top-left back
arrow and close any stray popup via close_x. Idempotent — safe to re-run (re-selecting the
same sort/brawler is a no-op, toggles are only tapped when ON).

A later, separate feature will reuse select_lowest_trophy_brawler() when a brawler hits
1000 trophies (prestige) to rotate to the new lowest — see the legacy planning notes (not ported).
