/**
 * Settings > Behavior: how a worker plays.
 *
 * Thirteen switches over two sections of the settings document, six of them plain and seven
 * behind Advanced, which starts collapsed because they are performance and safety switches
 * that are on for a reason. The schedule new instances start with sits under the plain six,
 * because a schedule is a default you set once and then forget about.
 *
 * Each row is built by one of the two helpers below rather than by a literal table, so the
 * key is checked against the settings type at compile time and the dotted loc the API sends
 * a 422 under is derived from it instead of typed out twice. The schedule row is written out
 * instead, because it writes scheduler.default_enabled rather than a behavior key.
 *
 * An advanced row also says what turning it off costs, and carries a Changed tag when it is
 * not at its model default. The defaults come from the API the first time Advanced opens
 * rather than from a copy kept here, so one pydantic model stays the only place they live.
