"""Shadow mode: the detector watches a match the farm loop is already playing.

``PlaySession`` is driven once per controller tick, the way ``MatchRecorder`` is. A daemon
thread behind it starts the frame source, loads the detector, reads the newest frame at
``RATE_HZ`` at most and writes one JSON line per inference under the instance's data folder. It
sends no input, it never touches the datalog, and it never raises into the loop: the thread hands
its events to a list under a lock and the controller thread drains them from ``observe()``.

The controller never waits for that thread either. The end of a match sets the stop flag and
returns; the thread stops the source, closes the file and queues its summary on its way out, and
the controller drains that row on a later tick. Only ``close()``, at process shutdown, joins.

The source is the emulator's own screen captures (``brawlfarm.play.capture``), not a live video
stream: one capture costs 180 to 280 ms, so a frame is 0.2 to 0.3 s old by the time the model
sees it.

Spec: the play mode design notes sections 1 and 5.
