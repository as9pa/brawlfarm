"""Alerts for the Fleet drawer (spec section 7).

The worker already writes alert-worthy events into its session JSONL and the push notifier
already turns them into a phone buzz (core/notify.py). This store collects the same kinds
for the panel: the feed tailer offers it every session line, and the supervisor hands it
the `offline` alert it raises itself. In memory only (ruling 3) -- alerts are a "look at
this now" list, not a record; the session files keep the history.
