"""Per-class confidence thresholds, and the ONNX in and out the exporter shares with them.

A detector that ships to the farm loop is allowed to miss things and is not allowed to invent
them: a false positive on a tap anchor is a tap on the wrong pixel. So a threshold is picked per
class as the lowest one that still buys MIN_PRECISION on the validation set, never a single
number for the whole model, and it never drops below FLOOR however clean a class looks.

This module is imported by train.py and export.py, which run in their own isolated environment
with rfdetr and torch in it and no brawlfarm. It therefore imports numpy and the standard
library only, and pulls cv2 in inside preprocess where a resize is unavoidable.
